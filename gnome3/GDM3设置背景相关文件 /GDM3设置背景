GDM Background Grey is loacated in /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/noise-texture.png
To change this you have to copy a background of your choice in the above folder- Rename noise-texture.png as noise-texture.png.bak and rename the background image you've copied as noise-texture.png.
You have to do this as root. (Every update to gnome-shell will replace your noise-texture.png with the original, so you have keep repeating the above after every gnome-shell upgrade)

To do this from GUI as root:
Code:
sudo nautilus /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme     //  --- some thing wrong  (zyf)
Find the file and do the necessary.

Then restart gnome-shell- Alt+F2, type 'r' and hit enter/return key.

------------------------------what i did ---------------------------------zyf

sudo ln -s /usr/share/images/desktop-base/noise-texture.png /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/noise-texture.png
//要用绝对路径
gnome-shell.css在/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/
