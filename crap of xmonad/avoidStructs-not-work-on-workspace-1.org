when I recompile and restart xmonad, or reboot system, or exit xmonad 
and login again, the xmobar will be blocked by other 
software(e.g. gnome-terminal if you spawn it), so I have to press 
mod-b(my mapping for ToggleStructs) twice, to set xmobar visiable.

solution: add docksEventHook to your handleEventHook
just like: handleEventHook    = docksEventHook <+> handleEventHook defaultConfig
