 this is very strange: 
 ----------------------------------
 my gnome3 got broken. i dont know why. 
 	almost everything in the gnome-panel cant click. and very slow.
	so, i want to uninstall gnome3 and replace it with xfce4.

 first i follow the (debian_wiki_Install_Xfce_in_already_installed_system)
	then i tried gnome3....  i dont know, but my gnome3 fixed again, like a miracle !!
	then i tried xfce4, but not work.
