This happened to me also on Ubuntu.

To fix I first cleaned / reinstalled tomcat6 using apt

sudo apt-get --purge remove tomcat6 tomcat6-common tomcat6-admin
sudo apt-get install tomcat6 tomcat6-common tomcat6-admin

Then launched using:

sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

Then check the error log when the fail message appears:

tail /var/log/tomcat6/catalina.2013-05-03.log
Got a few missing directory issues so fixed those, restarting each time until
no more errors appear here.

Then check the out log:

tail /var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out
This showed some java errors (missing classes).

After some searching found env variables not being set can cause issues, fixed
by adding these two lines to /etc/environment:

CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat6
CATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/tomcat6

Then imported these / checked with:

source /etc/environment
echo $CATALINA_HOME
Also fixed lib symlink using:

cd /var/lib/tomcat6
sudo ln -s /usr/share/java lib
After doing all of that the next restart worked and I am now able to see the
"It Works!" page by navigating to:

http://localhost:8080/
